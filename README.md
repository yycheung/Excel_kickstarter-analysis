# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to see how launch dates and funding goals influence the outcome of different campaigns. So that We are using the Kickstarter dataset as a source to analyse data and visualize the outcomes, in order to draw a conclusion.


## Analysis and Challenges
In this analysis, Excel is used as a tool to investigate Kickstarter dataset and do visualization by drawing line graphs. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
PivotTable in Excel is used to analyse how launch date affect the outcome of different campaigns. We displayed the result by months and sort the category in theater since the it's for a play show to reference. A line chart is generated to overview the number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns launched in different months. 

In the graph, we can see that the successful rate is on an increasing trend from January to May, and reaches the highest point in May, means May is the month that most campaigns can success by launching in this month, then it decreases from June to the lowest record in December. In view of the failed cases, they are roughly the same over the year, while May, June, July and October are especially close to each other. Not much campaigns canceled in our analysis, except January has relatively higher number but it is still a minority compare the the whole data size.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
We generated a table to calculate successful, failed and canceled rate in regarding to different goal, to see if the goal has an impact on the outcome. Only campaigns in "play" category are considered. A line graph is drawn to overview the data. 

From the graph, we can see lower goal amount has higher successful rate and low failed rate. It reaches the same level with the fund raising goal amount is 15000 to 19999. And from this point, failed rate is getting higher than successful rate. However, there is a fluctuation at the range 35000 to 44999, successful rate leads. And there is a high failed rate and very low successful rate if a campaign targeted to raise more than 45000. Since there is no canceled project in the category of play, so the cancellation rate is 0% regardless the fund raising goal. 

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered


## Results
From the analysis of Outcomes based on Launch Date, we can conclude that May is the best month to launch a campaign since it has the highest number of successful examples. While December is the worst month for launching a campaign because its successful rate is the lowest but with a relatively high failed rate, Besides, there is no drastic high failed rate in a specific month. It might be because there are other factors lead a campaign to fail other than launch date. 

From the analysis of Outcomes based on Goals, we can conclude that most successful campaigns have low fund raising goals. 

There are some limitations on the analysis, for example the Kickstarter dataset cannot represent every campaigns performances, though the data size is already over 4000. Secondly, the data is covered all over the world, so may not fully explain for the situation in specific country since cultural difference. Lastly, the dataset is not up to date, the most recent information is 2017, which is 5 years ago from now, the outcome might be different. 

To make this analysis be more sophisticated, we can generate more statistical tables such as measuring central tendency by calculating the mean, median and mode; examine how spread the data is by taking quadrilles into account; and considering the data distribution by looking at the standard deviation; last but not least to identify if there is any outlines affecting the result.
